### Introduction

This is the Class Project for Getting and Cleaning Data from Coursera
This folder contains three files other than this one

The CodeBook_GCD_Project.Rmd is a mark down file (word) which contains
a detailed description of the data, what it means and how it was taken 
and analyzed, as well as how it was processed by the program.

The HARdataSummary.txt file, which is a table with a summary of the data 
by subject and activity.  

The run_analysis.R file which is the R code which will go out, download
the data and do all the manipulation to result in the HARdataSummary.txt
file. 

** How to use these files **

First review CodeBook_GCD_Project which describes the study on which
the data was made.  This includes how the data was taken and processed,
and what the different variables mean.

Second if you want to just use the summary data, do it in R using
the read.table() command.  As a .txt file it is difficult to understand

Third if you want to recreate the HARdataSummary.txt data, or use some
of the parts of the original data created in makeing that summary, 
load the R code in run_analysis.R

** How the code works **

The code uses a read.data command in R to retrieve data from 
http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The code unzips the file into your working directory.

The data is slit into two "equal" sections, a test and train set for use with
a supervised learning program.  These two pieces are put back together into one
training set.  The column headers are replaced and the activity codes are 
translated back into their meaning (for example "walking" from a number code).

The dataframe is subset to just take columns that have mean or standard deviation
of other data, so that only these remain in the final analysis. 

The data is joined back with the "answers" of activity and subject to create
a single data frame.  

The last step is to create a summary table that looks at the mean of each of the 
data type by the "answer" data - subject and activity. This makes the nicest table
to just look at.
